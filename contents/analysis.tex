\chapter{Search for CP violation in gluon-gluon fusion events}\label{chap:analysis}

The performance of the measurement of the CP mixing angle in couplings of the Higgs boson to
top quarks is presented in this chapter.
First, kinematic observables that are sensitive to 
scalar and pseudoscalar couplings of the Higgs boson are introduced. Based on these observables categories are defined that
yield an enhanced fraction of ggF events and lead to a better sensitivity of the discriminating variables.
A new data-driven background estimation technique is presented to estimate the contribution of multijet and W+jets backgrounds. 
The measurement of the CP mixing angle $\alpha$ based on a pseudo-dataset is discussed in the last section of this chapter.
